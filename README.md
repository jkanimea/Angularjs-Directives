# Directives with Angular JS

This angularJs directive example was initially done by David Mosher. I have borrow his code because he got a excellent explanation on some advanced features in Angular, mapping from  HTML and explanation how this relates to angular directives, It also got some good  debugging techniques, tips and tricks. I had to modify initially to get working on web server using nodejs http.

It covers:

* html as a dsl
* abstractions in html
* [$compile](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile)
* [$templateRequest](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$templateRequest)
* [$templateCache](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$templateCache)
* [directive definition object](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile#directive-definition-object)
* [requiring other directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile#-require-)
* [directive communication ($scope.$broadcast, $scope.$on)](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/scope#scope-events-propagation)
